## Introduction

Budget Buddy is a Flask application that provides various features for budget management.

The application leverages SQLAlchemy for database operations, Flask-Login for user session management, and WeasyPrint for PDF generation.

## Challenges

1. User Authentication: Implementing secure user registration and login was crucial. We dove into Flask-Login and hashed passwords like our lives depended on it.
2. Database Design: Our database schema must accommodate various budget categories, transactions, and user profiles. SQLAlchemyâ€™s ORM came to the rescue.
3. PDF Reports: Generating beautiful PDF reports from budget data was challenging. We explored different libraries and settled on WeasyPrint for its flexibility.
